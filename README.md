# Formula1 car detection 
![cover.jpg](https://github.com/SwamiKannan/Formula1-car-detection/blob/main/cover.jpg)

## Project
 The Formula 1 television feed had a cool feature where the view from the t-cam (camera located on top of the engine) would show the car ahead with a bounding box along with the driver name.
 
 I took this idea forward and built a model that would detect the constructors of any car on the track / pit from any angle in a Formula 1 video
